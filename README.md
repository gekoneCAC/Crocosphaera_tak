Basic separation and analysis in ImageJ.
- If installing this macro to ImageJ use ".java" macro file but change the extension to ".txt"
- Or use ".txt" but it might be a bit out of date.

Operation:
- Open image of interest in ImageJ (FIJI).
- Press "S" to Start analysis. This will also create folders for data storage in the location of your file.
- If needed, draw missing parts (on the yellow-black image) of cells that for some reason are having holes or dents in structure. Tool for drawing is already automatically selected. When finished with single line, press "D" to Draw it permanently.
- When all dents are to your liking press "A" to Analyse first section.
- Now new image called "drawboard" will appear. On it you can "D" Draw lines as previously. This time lines are drawn to separate cells that weren't fully separated. When finished separating cells, press "C" to Continue.
